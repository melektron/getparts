# How to set up API Access


## DigiKey

1. Register/login for digikey API: [https://developer.digikey.com/](https://developer.digikey.com/)
2. Go to organizations tab:

    ![images/Untitled.png](../images/Untitled.png)

    (we're going to skip making a sandbox version of the app)

3. Create new organization
4. Click Production Apps next to your new organization 

    ![images/Untitled%201.png](../images/Untitled%201.png)

5. Create Production App
6. Fill in the details, paying special attention to the following:
    - **Name** - doesn't matter
    - **OAuth Callback** - [`https://localhost`](https://localhost/)
    - **Description** - doesn't matter
    - Select at least the following:

        ![images/Untitled%202.png](../images/Untitled%202.png)

7. Click add production app
8. Next screen should look like what's shown below. Click the app name (circled)

9. Open the `barcode_scan.py` file in a text editor and copy and paste the your Client ID (`BBB`) and Client Secret (`CCC`) from your app credentials into their respective fields:

    (note: you wont have a value for `code` yet)

        app_credentials= {
            'code': 'AAA',
            'client_id': "BBB",
            'client_secret': "CCC",
            'mouser_key': "DDD"
        }

10. Now ensure you have the necessary python3 libraries:

    Windows Powershell, Linux, & MacOS:

        pip3 install pyzbar, pylibmtx, opencv-python

    and if you want to use a webcam to scan barcodes:

        pip3 install opencv-python

    (note: your system may use `pip` instead of `pip3`. Either way, just make sure you're installing python3 packages)

11. Save and run the `barcode_scan.py` file using python3 and you will get an error message.

    Windows Powershell:

        PS C:\Users\USER\DEMO_DIRECTORY> python barcode_scan.py

    Linux/MacOS

        USER@DESKTOP:~/DEMO_DIRECTORY$ python barcode_scan.py

    **The error message should look similar to the one below, otherwise, troubleshoot the errors and try again.**

12. With a similar error message as shown above, proceed by copying the URL underlined in red. 
13. Open a new tab in your browser and paste the previously copied URL
14. You should be directed to a page that looks like this (you may need to log in). Click "Allow"

    ![images/Untitled%205.png](../images/Untitled%205.png)

15. Paste the copied code into the `barcode_scan.py` file replacing the `AAA` term:

        app_credentials= {
            'code': 'AAA',
            'client_id': "BBB",
            'client_secret': "CCC",
            'mouser_key': "DDD"
        }

16. After updating the 3 `app_credential` fields, save the `barcode_scan.py` file and run again.

    (note: the OAuth code is only good for 60 seconds. If you get an error saying the code expired, just navigate to the URL again and repeat the process)

17. A the first successful `barcode_scan.py` should look like this when starting:

    ![images/Untitled%206.png](../images/Untitled%206.png)

    Running subsequent `barcode_scan.py` (after the first successful startup) will look like this:

    (you shouldn't need to do the OAuth code any longer)

    ![images/Untitled%207.png](../images/Untitled%207.png)

18. If you have a webcam the example script will try and connect.

19. To return detailed product information, change `product_info=False` to `product_info=True`.

## Mouser

Mouser's API is easier to set up but much more limited in its capability.

1. Navigate to https://www.mouser.com/MyMouser/MouserSearchApplication.aspx and register for an API account

2. You'll recieve an email shortly containing an "API Key."

3. Enter the API key into the `DDD` field in barcode_scan.py:

        app_credentials= {
            'code': 'AAA',
            'client_id': "BBB",
            'client_secret': "CCC",
            'mouser_key': "DDD"
        }
